# Build a Dapp in 20 Minutes

Here are the tools we'll use in this tutorial:
1. Web3 JS - enables client side app to talk to blockchain
2. Metamask - enables browser to talk to blockchain
3. Ganache - local development blockchain
4. Remix - smart contract IDE


starter code is from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkZ6iYnSDRw

but it is kind of outdated so I updated some things

namely using a more recent version of web3.js (above 1.2)

and also using a version of solidity that is around version 0.8
